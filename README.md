# AdventureDemo-UE4-cpp

This is a little test demo that I am developing to improve with C++ and UE, I implemented everything with C++ without using the blueprints.
At the moment the features are:
- Player Movement
- Player Attack
- Player Death
- Enemy Attack and Movement logic
- The base logic of the animations is made in c++
